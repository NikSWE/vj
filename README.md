# Vocab Jam CLI

Building a superior vocabulary is crucial for getting a satisfactory score on the verbal section in the Graduate Record Examinations(GRE), It's a daunting and time consuming process. Gamifying this process doesn't only make it possible to achieve in a short amount of time but also makes it enjoyable. [Greg Mat](https://www.gregmat.com/), awesome GRE tutor, has compiled a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jRATLVV34vATsL4Y67fZZXQc7qZPYc0c0Yk7Bykh4fw/edit#gid=0) of words that you must know before taking the GRE. This repository uses his word list to create [vocab jams](https://www.vocabulary.com/articles/announcements/whos-ready-to-jam/) that you can enjoy with your friends at any time.
